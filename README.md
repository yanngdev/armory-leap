# Armory Leap Motion (WIP)

Brings the Leap Motion to Armory3D.

Uses websockets to get data from the device.

- Natively binds to the websocket when played in Browser.
- Needs a python script that writes the json in a file when played in Krom (included). May impact performances. [Currently only works on MacOS, crash on Windows]
